- Create framework for fully worked out variable: i.e. fixed, complete probability table as argument.

- Variable elimination:
    - Gather factors
    - Apply evidence to factors
    - Multiply two factors
    - Sum out factor

- Random sampling approach to networks.

- Figure out how to update hyperpriors (weighted influence)
